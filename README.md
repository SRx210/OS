<h4>Why OS?</h4>
<p>Have ever thought why we use OS?</p>
<p>Well, an OS is crucial and important in the computer field because it acts as a bridge between the hardware and the software. It manages computer hardware resources, such as the processor, memory, and storage devices, ensuring that programs run efficiently. The OS also provides essential services such as file management, user interface, and system security. Without an OS, users would find it challenging to interact with the computer, and software programs wouldn't have the necessary tools to function. In short, an OS makes computers usable, organized, and efficient for both users and applications.</p>
