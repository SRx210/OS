Experiment 4

Preemptive CPU scheduling is a scheduling algorithm that prioritizes tasks and allocates CPU time to the task with the highest priority.
This algorithm is often used in real-time systems.

This experiment is about CPU Scheduling Preemptive Method which contains the following methods:
- SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First or SJF with Preemption)
- Round Robin
- Priority (Lower Priority and Higher Priority)
